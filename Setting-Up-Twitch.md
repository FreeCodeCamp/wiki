3. Then submit your date of birth and your email address.
> It's important that you provide a correct email address as you will need this later to verify your account and get alerts when someone goes live.

4. Now all you need to do is complete the captcha and you're ready to rock!

5. Once you have signed up, you will receive an email regarding verifying your account.


#### Changing some Settings

Once you've logged in, go to the settings [page](https://www.twitch.tv/settings).

On this page you can change your profile picture, email address and write a bio. Unfortunately Twitch doesn't allow you to change your username once you've signed up. However, you change the capitalisation.
