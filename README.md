# Welcome to the Free Code Camp Wiki!

Our open source community's Wiki focuses on answering your questions about learning to code and getting a coding job. We also cover in detail our:

- Curriculum
- Local Campsite Communities
- Nonprofit Projects

## Get a Fork ready

You can get your own fork by using the button or clicking [this](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/new/master?readme=1#fork-destination-box).
Once you get a fork, you will clone it with `git clone url` where `url` is the link to your fork.

Once that is done, you can start contributing by checking our [issues](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/issues) and creating nee pull requests.

## Contribution Guides

We currently have a couple of guides to help you contribute, via the browser, command line or desktop application.

- [How To Contribute From Your Browser:](Wiki-Contribute-Online) This is currently the easiest way we have to contribute. A simplified version can be found on [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-land-your-first-open-source-contribution-from-your-browser-in-15-minutes-756d9bbf81ad) also.
- [How To Contribute To The Wiki Locally:](Wiki-Contribute-Local-GUI) This is a guide that will show you how to have a local copy so you can make changes from your computer, it also works for contributing to the main repository.
- [Pull Request Guidelines](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)
- [More on how to make a pull request from a fork](Pull-Request-Contribute)
- [How to Squash Commits:](git-rebase#squashing-multiple-commits-into-one) We required only one commit per Pull Request unless otherwise specified by a moderator.

you can find this and much more guides and information on the [Wiki Central Page](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Wiki).
