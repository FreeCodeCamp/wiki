<a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a>, PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, is a widely-used open source, general purpose scripting language. It’s especially suited for web development and can easily be embedded in HTML. 

PHP is executed on the server and returns HTML to the client. The client is whoever is looking at that web site. 

PHP is used mainly on server side scripting, but you can do almost anything with PHP. You can collect data, generate dynamic page content, or even send and receive cookies. That’s not even the tip of the iceberg. 

PHP can be used on all major operating systems. It also has support for most of the web servers in use today. 

PHP also supports an array of databases. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and many more. Basically put, PHP can do so many things in so many ways and do it all just about anywhere. 

As you make your way through this tutorial, you’ll notice that PHP isn’t exactly written like many other OOP languages. Don’t let this scare you, you’ll quickly see that it is easy and fun. If you’re completely new to PHP, I’ll post a small code example so you get this joke…...PHP is money!!!

<?php
$text = “Hello World!”;
?>

You will see ‘$’ a lot in PHP programming. That’s why some PHP developers joke that PHP is money!!!
