We came across a lot of codes on free code camp website. We saw the tasks, learnt various syntax and after brainstorming, we successfully wrote some codes. But have you ever wondered how to run these codes while making something of your own and running this types of codes on your local machines?

So, here are the steps to follow for front end development:
1. Make an empty document on you system, where you wish to store the file. 
2. Give the file an extension ".html" while naming it. 
3. When you are over with writing your code in it, close it and open it in your browser.

And here you go. You can see your own website, made on your system which runs on your browser. 

I was puzzled when for the first time after completing loads of tutorials, I wanted to run this on my system. So, try yourself. Hope this helps.
