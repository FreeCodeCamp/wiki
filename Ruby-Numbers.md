# Ruby Numbers

### Basics:

- Ruby has two categories of numbers - integers and floating-point (also called floats).
- Integers are whole numbers that can be positive or negative but cannot be fractions.
- Floats are numbers with a decimal place.
- Depending on their size, numbers can have the class `fixnum` or `bignum`.

## Examples:

```ruby
x = 5
x.class
# returns
Fixnum
```

```ruby
x = 11122233344455566677
x.class
# returns
Bignum # basically is a very large number
