# String Operations

### Both concatenation and multiplication can be performed on strings.

## Concatenation:

*	Strings can be joined together using the `+` operator.


```ruby
"Hello" + " World" + "!"
# returns:
Hello World!
```

## Multiplication:

*	Strings can be multiplied by an integer value using the `*` operator.


```ruby
"Hello" * 3
# returns:
HelloHelloHello
```
