Online vs Offline IDE
There are several offline IDE that programmers use in order to stay more productive to learn and be more productive at work: 

Eclipse is a free editor that is both online and offline incorporates Java, C/C++, JavaScript, and PHP by IBM. Its biggest advantages are code completion by tabbing method which saves a lot of time writing documentations. It has a build in syntax check to fix any mistype words while coding a project. All of features we've come to expect of an IDE are their code completion, templates, integration with various SCMSs, and integration with build systems. Its code formatting and cleanup tools are very powerful. I find its build system to work well and intuitively. I think these are the things upon which its reputation is really built. Furthermore it has a refactoring that find and replace function, variables and classes of a specific work. Eclipse offers more plugins, platforms, frameworks, and simpler to use compare to other IDE such as IntelliJ, BlueJ and JEdit. 
NetBeans is a free intuitive editor that does it all compared from other IDE. It has simple Swing GUI design tool to build user interfaces by dragging and dropping components for instance buttons, textboxes. The disadvantage it is that with all its features it is slow to load and uses more memory than other IDEâ€™s. 
IntelliJ IDEA it is the most efficient offline editor however it is not free. It is faster than most editors however it has numbers of problems. Some major advantages is using too much memory from system, 
BlueJ is a simple editor mostly used to teach java and object oriented programming. The main advantage of BlueJ over other IDE is that it does not need a main method to run the program.
JEdit

However there are several differences between online editors and the offline editors:
CodeRun Studio is an online IDE that you build web application. It allows you to run and test code online. It supports PHP, AJAX, and ASP.NET but there is a 14 days trial then it must be paid. It is difficult to save your project since you must pay in order to fully operate it.  

An offline IDE will be more beneficial to a programmer rather than an online IDE due to the fact that large projects will slow down and that a software team will need a reasonable office internet service. If there is a major storm the connection will be affected causing many projects to be unfinished and incomplete. The only advantages of online IDE is that projects can be access everywhere; there are no setup and configurations. There is no hardware limitation since all information will be stores in cloud.
