Hypertext Markup Language [(HTML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. 

HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) which affect the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium [(W3C)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.
