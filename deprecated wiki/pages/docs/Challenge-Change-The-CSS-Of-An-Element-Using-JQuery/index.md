# Change the CSS of an Element Using jQuery

We can also change the CSS of an HTML element directly with jQuery.

Query has a function called `.css()` that allows you to change the CSS of an element.

```html
<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#target1").css("color", "red");

  });
</script>
```
