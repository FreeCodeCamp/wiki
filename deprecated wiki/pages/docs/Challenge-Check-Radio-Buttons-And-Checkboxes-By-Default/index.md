# Challenge Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default

You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.

To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. For example,

```html
<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>
```
