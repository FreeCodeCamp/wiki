# HTML - Document Type Declaration
HTML documents are required to start with a [Document Type Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_declaration) (informally, a "doctype"). In browsers, the doctype helps to define the rendering modeâ€”particularly whether to use quirks mode.

The original purpose of the doctype was to enable parsing and validation of HTML documents by SGML tools based on the Document Type Definition (DTD). The DTD to which the DOCTYPE refers contains a machine-readable grammar specifying the permitted and prohibited content for a document conforming to such a DTD. Browsers, on the other hand, do not implement HTML as an application of SGML and by consequence do not read the DTD.

HTML5 does not define a DTD; therefore, in HTML5 the doctype declaration is simpler and shorter:

> !DOCTYPE html

This declaration references the DTD for the "strict" version of HTML 4.01. SGML-based validators read the DTD in order to properly parse the document and to perform validation. In modern browsers, a valid doctype activates standards mode as opposed to [quirks mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode).
