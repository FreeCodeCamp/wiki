###Choosing a Plan

Currently, the free plan only gives you 1 free private workspace. If you need more memory for your projects, you might want to consider
a paid plan (figure 1).

###Privatize

First, head on over to the Cloud 9 website (https://c9.io) and log in (or sign up if you don't have an account). On the main page, click
the plus button under the **Workspace** heading (figure 2.1) or the one at the top left navigation bar (figure 2.2).
