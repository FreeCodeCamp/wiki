Translation is an all-or-nothing proposal.

We won't be able to add new languages to Free Code Camp until all of our 
challenges are translated into that language.

In addition to translating these initially, we'll also need to maintain 
the translation as the challenges are gradually updated (we use the 
github issue system to keep record).  

If you're able to help us, please join the gitter channel 
https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Translators 
And also join the channel for translators of your specific language 
(if it exists):

* Amharic [FreeCodeCamp/TranslationAmharic](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/TranslationAmharic)
* Brazilian Portuguese: [FreeCodeCamp/BrazilianPortuguese](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/BrazilianPortuguese)
* French [FreeCodeCamp/TranslationFrench](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/TranslationFrench)
* German [FreeCodeCamp/TranslationDeutsch](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/TranslationDeutsch)

If it doesn't exist please let us know in the 
[Translators channel](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Translators), 
or create one yourself and share it at the  
[translators channel](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Translators) 
and at other places to invite more translators and reviewers that speak your 
language.  

We invite you to read some [**recommendations**](https://github.com/vtamara/fcc_trad/blob/master/Recomendaciones.EN.md) based on the spanish team experience.

Please adapt them to your team (we encourage you to translate them to make 
it easier for people that speaks your language).
