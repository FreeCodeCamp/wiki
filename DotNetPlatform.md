# The .NET Platform 

.NET platform is big and comprehensive collection of frameworks and libraries manager by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/net). In the beginning it could be quite daunting to get familiar with .Net ecosystem.

Our aim is to get you familiar with the .Net platform, so that you are ready to learn the c# programing language along with development environment, project structures, techniques and best practices you will be performing as a professional developer.

Let's get some of the jargon's out of the way, don't worry, you don't need to know in-depth about these at this point.

* [.Net Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/w0x726c2(v=vs.110).aspx) : (pronounced dot net) provides configuration for your application to run on top of it. 
It provides all the services an app needs for instance communication with database, networks, file systems which are commonly used to build console, desktop, web, mobile and game applications.

 * CLR (Common Language Runtime) : is an execution environment for your application, which manages it's life-cycle.
     1. It provides services like memory management.
     2. Is operating system and hardware independent.
     3. and language independent, for instance can be used for c#, vb.net and f#.
 
 * Compiler : a csc.exe is a compiler, which transforms c# code into Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), which is commonly referred as IL. It defines instructions which CLR can understand. CLR job is to read these instructions and convert into instructions which your machine's CPU undertansds.
 
 * Class libraries : It containes thousands of in-build classes for your application use, for example System.IO for reading/writing data streams, HttpClient send data over network, ASP.NET for web applications, ADO.NET for data access to relational databases (like Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL), and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) for service-oriented applications which communicates over established protocols like like HTTP, REST, SOAP and TCP etc.

 * The C# Programming Language (pronounced "C-sharp") : 
    1. used to write applications, services and reusable libraries.
    2. Has syntax similar as Java, c++ and javascript. 
    3. Designed to work with .net platform.
    4. Strongly typed, high level object oriented language.

* [.Net Core] (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2014/12/04/introducing-net-core/) : is microsoft recent endeavour to move towards opens source, cross platform development, delivered as a nuget packages. They are working with [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) community, which is an implementation of Microsoft .Net framework to apps on Windows, Linux and Mac.

* [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/): is package manager for .Net applications.

* [Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/) : primarily intended to focus on web browsers plug-in to provide enrich multimedia.
  
* [.Net for windows app](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/br230302.aspx) : used to create Windows 8.x Store apps using C#.
