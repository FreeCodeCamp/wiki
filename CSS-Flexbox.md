## CSS Flexbox 

CSS Flexbox allows us to easily format our HTML like you never knew was possible, with flexbox it is possible to align vertically and horizontally, easily. Like the sound of it? Yeah me too.

It is also fansastic for general layout of your website or app, it is easy to learn, supported well (in all modern broswers) and is great to work with, not to mention it doesn't take long to get to grips with at all!
