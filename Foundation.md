# Foundation

Foundation is the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world (According to their website).

## Getting Started

Here is a simple HTML template which includes the latest compiled and minified CSS and Javascript for the Foundation library.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Foundation Template</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/foundation/6.2.1/foundation.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <!-- Add all HTML Code here -->
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/foundation/6.2.1/foundation.min.js"></script>
  </body>
