<h1>Reset or revert a specific file to a specific revision using Git</h1>


You can quickly review the changes made to a file using the diff command:

'''git diff <commit hash> <filename>'''
Then to revert a specific file to that commit use the reset command:
'''git reset <commit hash> <filename>'''
A good workflow for managaging waypoints is to use tags to cleanly mark points in your timeline. I can't quite understand your last sentence but what you may want is diverge a branch from a previous point in time. To do this, use the handy checkout command:

'''git checkout <commit hash>
git checkout -b <new branch name>'''
You can then rebase that against your mainline when you are ready to merge those changes:
''' git checkout <my branch>
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge <my branch>'''
