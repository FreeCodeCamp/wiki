Online vs Offline Editors
=======

#### There are several offline IDE that programmers use in order to stay more productive to learn and be more productive at work:
 

1.**Eclipse** is more than a Java editor. Its biggest advantages are code completion by tabbing method which saves a lot of time writing documentations. 


Secondly, it has build in syntax check to fix any mistype words while coding a project. All of
features we've come to expect of an IDE are their code completion, templates, integration with various SCMSs, and integration with build systems. 


Its code formatting and cleanup tools are very powerful. I find its build system to work well and intuitively. I think these are the things upon which its reputation is really built. Furthermore it has a refactoring that find and replace function, variables and classes of a specific work. 


2.**NetBeans** is a free intuitive editor that does it all compared from other IDE. It has simple Swing GUI design tool to build user interfaces by dragging and dropping components for instance buttons, textboxes. 


The disadvantage of Netbeans is all the features takes a lot of memory from the computer compared to other IDE's. 


3.**BlueJ** is a simple editor mostly used to teach java and object oriented programming. The main advantage of the editor over other ones is that it does not need a main method to run the program.

#### However there are several differences between online editors and the offline editors:

4.**CodeRun Studio** is an online IDE that you build web application. It allows you to run and test code online. It supports PHP, AJAX, and ASP.NET but there is a 14 days trial then it must be paid. It is difficult to save your project since you must pay in order to fully operate it. 


An offline IDE will be more beneficial to a programmer rather than an online IDE due to the fact that large projects will slow down and that a software team will need a reasonable office internet service. If there is a major storm
the connection will be affected causing many projects to be unfinished and incomplete. 


The only advantages of online IDE is that projects can be access everywhere, but there are no setup and configurations. There is no hardware limitation since all information will be stores in cloud.
