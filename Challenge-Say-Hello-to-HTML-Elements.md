
## Challenge: Say Hello to HTML Elements

Welcome to Free Code Camp's first coding challenge.

You can edit **code** in your **text editor**, which we've embedded into this web page.

Do you see the code in your text editor that says `<h1>Hello</h1>`? That's an HTML **element**.

Most HTML elements have an **opening tag** and a **closing tag**.

Opening tags look like this:

`<h1>`

Closing tags look like this:

`</h1>`

Note that the only difference between opening tags and closing tags is that closing tags have a slash after their opening angle bracket.

Each challenge has tests that you can run at any time by clicking the "Run tests" button. Once you get all tests passing, you can advance to the next challenge.

To pass the test on this challenge, change your h1 element's text to say "Hello World" instead of "Hello". Then click the "Run tests" button.

### Important notes about this template.
- This template can be used for FCC wiki challenge guides.
- The author part has been removed. This is a collaboration page, while people can see who contributed by checking the revision, using the code for the credits will also benefit the contributors and your name will be there, so there is no longer any need to add your picture or links.
