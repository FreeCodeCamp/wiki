FreeCodeCamp uses Twitch.tv to broadcast live streams. This can be anything from live pair programming to our monthly Summit, where big news events and new developments are announced.

All levels of coders are encouraged to stream on the FreeCodeCamp twitch channel. If this is something that would interest you, please contact the twitch mods on [gitter](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/LiveCoding).

More information on how to stream can be found [here](Stream-Your-Coding-Sessions-on-Twitch.tv).
