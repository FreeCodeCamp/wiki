     Hello World!  This is my first stab at a contribution so please don't laugh, just yet!  
     I spend much of my time thinking of ways to improve the worlds process.  
     Hence this is the reason why I have continually sought after was to learn code!  
     The one thing which I have avoided for years now, out of fear, ignorance and pure resistance.  
     However, I now say that coding is the solution to almost all of my past problems in life.  
     Thank you Lawrence Bradford for helping me to find Freecodecamp.com! Hooray!
     One of my past projects was in 2007, when I submitted for an provisional patent to improve the Sony e-book reader, 
     I did not have the money knowledge or experience to get a patent attorney, utilize Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA), 
     or the best way to search for Venture Capital. Hence, failure was upon me.  
     For the patent process I went through Legal-Zoom (I don't think that was a very smart move)!  
     The Non-Disclosure, I felt as though I was just a push over submitting and exposing my idea to Intel, 3M, 
     and a company out of Ohio named 3rd Frontier ( a one hour and eight minute phone call just giving it all away)!
     Venture Capital - I don't think so!
     Anyway; however untimely, Amazon then comes out with the Amazon Kindle while I'm just waiting for 
     Legal Zoom to just answer back my phone calls!  All feels lost, and essentially it was!
     
     I have a new a improved IDEA for that process now (bright light *!*) which throughly out pace the thought process of the KINDLE!
     But that will be cover, much later.  Like post creation, and post production later! :-D
     So here is my conceptual thought about saving time at the register with Python and Monary.
     I will lay this IDEA right out there, build upon it, trash it, construtively criticize it or just laugh about it! 
     So here we go!
     Most all of us use some form of a card at the register when at a Point Of Sale (POS) location, but what of those of us who use cash?
     How long does it take, even with the register doing the input, output math for the cashier?
     Well consider how long you are waiting on the line at WALMART when someone pulls out cash and the cahier has to return the change.
     Even using an automated register with a cash input take a considerable amount of time to retrieve your cash from the register. Money
     can be saved and productivity can be improved by saving time at the transactional state.  The throughput of the POS transaction
     would be drastically reduce in the grand scheme of transactions.
     So I would call it the "Keep The Change Card (KTCC)"! Or a KTTC app on the cell phone!
     Just using WALMART as a testpoint.
     Process:  1.  A shopper purchases items at the store, and pays with cash.
               2.  When the transaction is about to end then the shopper would place the KTCC in the register.
               3.  The output change response is added to the KTCC.
               4.  The shopper walks away and could use accrued cash and change off of the KTCC.
               5.  If WALMART was the first to use this then they could charge a micro transactional fee.
               6.  WALMART could bank the shoppers money and gain profit from it until the shopper uses the accured cash!
               7.  The shopper could use the KTTC at many different networked merchants.
               8.  The shopper would never really feel the micro charge as it could be a penny for every ten transactions.
               9.  A company like OuterWall in Seattle could also have a lot to gain if they were to implemnt this process.
               10. OuterWall would not have to actually move coins anylonger, as the coins would no longer be physically moving!
               
  This is the process of making money from money!  Who does not love that?
  
  Well that is my conceptual contribution.  Please let me know what you think?  I have many more where that one came from!  Even ideas
  for video games not thought of yet, and automobiles, etc.
