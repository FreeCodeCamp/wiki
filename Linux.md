## Origins of Linux and the Free Software Movement
In the 1980s a famous MIT hacker working for the Artificial Intelligence lab named [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) promoted the sharing of knowledge and ideas freely, specifically within the area of software. [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) was the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) (OS) of choice by many in the engineering and scientific community, but the problem was UNIX was [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software). This meant only the vendors of the OS had access to the [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code). That went against Stallman's philosophy. Not only did this mean the end users were not allowed to see how the software worked, they could not make any improvements or fixes to it if they could.

Stallman started the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation) (FSF) which supported the [free software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement)'s ideals (Individuals who use and collaboratively contribute to open and free software). It was also responsible for starting the [GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project) in 1984 which was the first attempt at a free OS that was not UNIX (GNU is a recursive algorithm for 'GNUs not UNIX'). The GNU Project would include everything useful found on a UNIX system but written from scratch. More importantly, along with the OS the source code would also be legally available to those who wanted it. The idea was that freely exchanging the source code and inner knowledge of the OS would encourage collaborative development, which in turn would create a better OS product. The GNU Project eventually led to the [GNU Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) (GPL) which legalized all software released under it to be made freely available as well as require providing the source code. While the GPL was a success and still used today to license free software, the GNU Project never took off as planned. Another hacker stepped in and provided his implementation of a free Operating System to the world instead.


[Linux Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), a Finnish student from the University of Helsinki, first created [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) while experimenting with a free and smaller version of UNIX used for educational purposes called [MINIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX) which was developed by [Andrew Tantebatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_S._Tanenbaum). Linus wanted to have a similar free OS that didn't have the constraints of being limited to pure educational use. He created Linux which he licensed under the GPL and distributed on the Internet in 1991. Linus didn't use any code from MINIX, but he incorporated the features found in MINIX/UNIX which is why Linux is often called ["UNIX-like"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) or a "UNIX clone".

Over time Linux began to gather strong traction within the free software movement. Thousands of developers around the world started experimenting and using it, making contributions where they saw fit. As it became more stable and feature-rich, businesses slowly started to adopt Linux as a solution for their needs and even started contributing to Linux themselves. Linux reaches many devices and environments to this day and continues to grow in popularity.


## Who runs Linux?

- Linux now operates on the majority of smartphones and tablets around the world via the [Android][1] OS (based off the Linux kernel). As of March 2016 Android holds [60.99%](https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=8&qpcustomd=1) of the market share on mobile devices (tablets and smartphones). It also holds [82.8%](http://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp) for smartphones alone (per 2015 Q2 numbers).
- As of March 2016, Alexa reported that [96.55%](http://www.w3cook.com/os/summary/) of the top 1 million Internet domains in the world are powered by servers running Linux.
- The [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange), the largest stock exchange in the world which trades securities worth billions of dollars daily are executed by servers that run on Linux after moving away from UNIX.
- The White House powers their web servers using [Red Hat Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat) and [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server).
- The US Department of Defense (DoD) uses Linux to run their nuclear submarine fleet.
- The US Navy uses Linux for ground control software.

##Why run Linux?

- **Constant and efficient improvements.**
    Linux updates happen through the global collaboration of developers. Bugs are documented and resolved much quicker with this type of support. Also, since the developers are also the end-users they have a motivation to make sure it meets user's needs and that it is designed to run well.
- **Less risk.**
    Software is only as good as the support is given. Imagine a piece of software was created by ABC company and they go bankrupt or get bought by another company that decides to cut support. The software would never see improvements or fixes and therefore its usefulness would inevitably erode and die. Linux is owned and operated by no single entity or company, so this situation cannot happen. More than that anyone is free to pick it up and contribute as well. The risk of losing support for Linux is very unlikely due to its overwhelming popularity and use.
- **Lightweight.**
    Linux's requirements for running on a system are much lower than that of Windows or Mac. With the right Linux distribution a user can have a modest setup and Linux will give the system value. Disk space and memory footprint can also be lower too. Some distributions are suitable for CPUs dating back to the Pentium family, others have a requirement of as little as 128MB of RAM and around the same amount for disk space!
- **Heavily documented for beginners and advanced users alike.**
    Linux has an active community of those willing to share their knowledge and help (much like FreeCodeCamp!). There are command line utilities built into Linux that provide documentation on commands, libraries, standards, etc. ([Man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) and [Info pages][2], and there is documentation available on the Internet in a variety of formats ([The Linux Documentation Project](http://www.tldp.org/), [LinuxQuestions](http://www.linuxquestions.org/), [ServerFault](http://serverfault.com/). There are self-paced certifications that can be taken that are recognized in the IT industry ([CompTIA's Linux+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/linux) and [LPI's LPIC tests](https://www.lpi.org)). Although not required, learning [C][3] gives the ability for a user to review the Linux code to see what they are running.
- **Business support.**
  The world depends on Linux supporting critical systems so the demand is not going away. This is important not only to those that help contribute to Linux, but also to those who support it (Jobs!). Linux support becomes more critical in IT, but also having that knowledge as a developer will make them more rounded and useful (i.e. [Full stack developers](https://medium.com/chris-messina/the-full-stack-employee-ed0db089f0a1#.ubttrv255)).
- **Interoperability with other Operating Systems.**
  Linux has driver support for NTFS and HFS+ filesystems (used by Windows and Macs) and also [Samba](https://www.samba.org/) for file/print service support on Windows machines. 
- **Better hardware support.**
  For other OSs, usually a user would have to go to the manufacturer's website to get driver support for different types of hardware. The Linux kernel supports a majority of hardware automatically via plug-and-play (largely in part because of the open source community).
- **Software Availability/Compatibility.**
    Linux has a rich set of applications that are available. It has [office applications](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/libreoffice/), [browsers](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/), [media players](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/), [image](https://www.gimp.org/)/[video processing](http://www.openshot.org/), etc. For video gaming, [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/about/) runs on Linux which has many supported games. Windows applications can also run within Linux (see [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) for details).
- **Built for development.**
As Linux was originally made for developers by developers, they have spent much time and effort perfecting the tools that they would come to use. It has a powerful [shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) that can be used for a variety of both programming and administrative tasks ([Bash][4] is the most popular and default choice for Linux).
While Linux has a "notepad" equivalent in [gedit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit), it also provides more powerful and customizable text-based editors such as [Vim][5] and [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) (It is recommended Linux users know at least one of these editors). There are also IDEs available for web-development such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Aptana](http://www.aptana.com/)/[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [KomodoIDE](http://komodoide.com/), to name a few.
Linux also can utilize software such as [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) to setup a local web server for testing, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control, and other tools/languages such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)/[SaSS](http://sass-lang.com/)/[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) all have support on Linux and have command line tools that can be used in lieu of a GUI.
- **It's Free.**
  Hard to beat that!

## How to get Linux

While most vendors provide one OS that gets incremental updates and new versions over time (e.g. Windows, Mac OSX, Solaris), Linux has hundreds of different versions to choose from created by different vendors. This is in part because Linux is freely-distributed code which can be tailored to specific user's needs. While the [Linux Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) typically stays the same (core functionality of the OS handling tasks like network management, disk usage, memory utilization, I/O etc.), the many different versions of Linux differ in parts such as which GUI it uses (i.e. [Gnome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome), [KDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE), [XFCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce), or none at all), system tools, environments, package managers, and applications provided. This unique collection of software along with the kernel define what we call a [Linux Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) (distro for short). 

Opinions on which distribution to choose varies between users, but it is best to choose one that has a seamless installation procedure and is regularly updated with vulnerability and bug fixes. Popular mainstream Linux distributions like [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), [Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/), and [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) have this covered. These all have great support and a large collection of available software to use for free.
 Another item to consider is language support, some distributions have better support in specific languages than others. For example, [OpenSUSE](https://en.opensuse.org/Main_Page) has strong support for the German Language, and [Ubuntu Kylin](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/ubuntu-kylin) is a subversion of Ubuntu that was more suitable for Chinese users using Simplified Chinese. Check [DistroWatch](http://distrowatch.com/search.php) to search for support in other languages.

Most versions of Linux have a feature that allows the user to test out the distribution before installing it to disk in what is called a [live CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD) or a [live USB](http://www.linuxliveusb.com/). A user can put a smaller version of the distribution either burned onto a CD/DVD or a USB drive and boot from it. It will leave a user's current OS intact but they are free to experiment with the user interface and some of the applications. Most distributions will provide a way of using live media first for testing, and later while using the live media be given an option to install the OS onto disk permanently.

For users wishing to keep their current OS or not wishing to make a full transition, another option is to create a virtualized environment and install Linux in it using a tool such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). A user can run their current OS and have a VirtualBox window running with a Linux distribution in it. This would be an ideal situation for someone who wants to keep running Windows or OSX, but still have access to a Linux environment.
