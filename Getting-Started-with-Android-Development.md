# Getting started with Android Development

So, you want to get started with Android development? Let me take you through some basic steps you should go through.

#### Tools
At first, make sure you have all the tools in your system. The things you'll need to start building application for Android are:
* [Latest version of the Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* If possible, an Android device

Some basic courses and tutorials for learning Android development:
* [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853)
* [Tutorial by developers at Google](http://developer.android.com/training/index.html)
* [TutorialsPoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/)

So, what are you waiting for? Just start right away!

For any help, [StackOverflow](stackoverflow.com) is there anyway!
